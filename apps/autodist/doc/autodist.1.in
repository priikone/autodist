.SH NAME
Autodist \- Source distribution management system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B autodist
[options] [distribution] [version]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Autodist is a source distribution management system that allows 
powerful mechanisms to define what is included in and excluded from a 
distribution, and what license the distribution is released under.  It is 
also used to create the actual distribution source packages.  Autodist 
allows distribution management in file, directory and file content level.  
Different distributions may include different portions of files, for 
example, excluding certain features from certain distributions.  It is 
always guaranteed that anything not defined for the distribution, is 
removed automatically (files, file content, directories), thus ensuring 
that nothing is accidentally included in the distribution.
.PP
Autodist is closely related to the Autoconf and Automake tools, and 
complements the features Autoconf and Automake provides.  It is especially 
targeted into circumstances where multiple distributions are created from 
one source tree.  The Autoconf and Automake environment is mainly designed 
for one application per one source tree situations.  Autodist provides 
mechanisms to create all kinds of distributions that can be created from 
one source tree.  To be able to use Autodist, the Autoconf and Automake 
must be installed into the system.
