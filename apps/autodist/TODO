TODO In Autodist
================

o Better 'license-header' implementation.

o Perhaps ability to partially re-license the source tree.  Now all files
  will be processed if 'license-header' is used.

o Better 'noprocess' so that it would work with directories recursively,
  such as noprocess foo/bar, would not process anything under foo/bar.
