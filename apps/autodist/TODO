TODO In Autodist
================

o Autodist should produce output file when 'license-header' is used for
  files that _was not_ re-licensed.  This would be useful to check if
  there are files in the distribution with wrong license.

o Better 'license-header' implementation.

o Perhaps ability to partially re-license the source tree.  Now all files
  will be processed if 'license-header' is used.

o Perhaps output autodist.log when processing the source tree.
