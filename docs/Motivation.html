Autodist is a source distribution management system that allows powerful
mechanisms to define what is included in and excluded from a distribution
and what license is used. It is especially targeted at large software
projects that create multiple distributions from a source tree. Autodist
supports distribution management in directory, file, and file content
level, and automatic relicensing of a distribution.-->

<h3 class="section">1.1 Reasons for using Autodist</h3>

<p>Autodist is closely related to the Autoconf and Automake tools, and
complements the features Autoconf and Automake provides.  It is especially
targeted into circumstances where multiple distributions are created from
one source tree.  The Autoconf and Automake environment is mainly designed
for one distribution (one application) per one source tree situations. 
Autodist provides mechanisms to create all kinds of distributions that can
be created from one source tree.  To be able to use Autodist, the Autoconf
and Automake must be installed into the system (see <a href="Integrating-Autodist.html#Integrating-Autodist">Integrating Autodist</a>). 
Autoconf version must be at least 2.52g.

   <p>Small software projects usually do very well with Autoconf and Automake
and their distribution management features.  Often these projects do not
need Autodist, though they can benefit from it.  However, if your software
project is large, you need to create multiple distributions from one source
tree, you have complex licensing terms for different distributions, you
have different target users or customers that may require different
feature set or licenses in different distributions, you have need to
continue concurrent development in the main source tree and still be able
to create stable distributions, and/or you have need to control file
content in different distributions (to avoid distributing code or features
that aren't supposed to be distributed, or to avoid leaking information
to your competitors on what new features you are working on), then Autodist
is a tool you may find usefull.

   <p>The motivation behind Autodist stems from need to be able to create
multiple distributions from one large source tree in a precise and
controllable manner, and guarantee that anything that is not part of the
distribution is removed from the distribution.  The Autoconf and Automake
provides mere basic control what is included in and excluded from
distributions and how the distributions are created.  They also do not
provide mechanism to define different licensing conditions for different
distributions, or changing the license automatically for different user
or customer purposes.  Many large software projects, companies and
corporations have commonly been using Autoconf and Automake tools, but
have had the need to create their own ad-hoc mechanisms to control
distribution creation.  The Autodist attempts to provide a tool that any
size software project can effectively use to manage their distributions.

   <p>Without a tool like Autodist, large software projects usually have to be
split into separate source trees, which may not always be possible because
they may share large portions of common code (which may further make
concurrent development of the applications hard), or multiple Autoconf and
Automake environments (multiple configure scripts) needs to be created
in one source tree.  In this case the source tree usually gets very
complicated and controlling what is compiled and what is included in
distributions becomes harder, especially when different parts code is shared
between applications and libraries.
