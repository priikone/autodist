Autodist is a source distribution management system that allows powerful
mechanisms to define what is included in and excluded from a distribution
and what license is used. It is especially targeted at large software
projects that create multiple distributions from a source tree. Autodist
supports distribution management in directory, file, and file content
level, and automatic relicensing of a distribution.-->

<h3 class="section">3.2 Creating distribution package(s)</h3>

<p>Before creating a new distribution package, you will need to prepare
the source tree for the distribution you want to create.  After preparing
your source tree you will be ready to create a new distribution.  The
Autodist package provides a simple helper script 'makedist' that may
be used to create the distribution.  However, if you wish, you may
run the Autodist yourself, as the 'makedist' will call Autodist anyway.

   <p>To create a new distribution for the distribution you have prepared for,
run first './configure' and then 'makedist'.

<pre class="example">       makedist
</pre>
   <p>This will run the Autodist and create a new distribution package that
is archived with 'tar' and compressed with 'gzip'.  If you wish to
create packages also compressed with 'bzip2', 'compress' and/or 'zip'
you may give one or all of the following options:

<pre class="example">       makedist --bzip2 --compress --zip
</pre>
   <p>This example would create, in addition of 'tar.gz' package, also a
'tar.bz2', 'tar.Z' and '.zip' packages.  Current version of Autodist does
not support archiving with 'shar'.

   <p>If you wish to run additional processing for your distributions when they
are being packaged you may set 'pre-process-dist-hook',
'post-process-dist-hook, 'pre-dist-hook' and/or 'post-dist-hook' in your
distribution file.  Also note that any hooks provided by Automake in
Makefiles will be run in normal manner.

   <p>When creating the distribution Autodist creates a log file,
'makedist.log', that will include messages created by Autodist.  It is
suggested that this file is checked after distribution is created.  For
example, when the 'license-header' directive is used to re-license the
distribution, the 'makedist.log' will include list of files that were not
re-licensed.  The log file can be used to verify that the distribution was
re-licensed correctly, and fix any possible mistakes.
