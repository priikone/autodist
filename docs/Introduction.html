Autodist is a source distribution management system that allows powerful
mechanisms to define what is included in and excluded from a distribution
and what license is used. It is especially targeted at large software
projects that create multiple distributions from a source tree. Autodist
supports distribution management in directory, file, and file content
level, and automatic relicensing of a distribution.-->

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>The Autodist is a source distribution management system that allows
powerful mechanisms to define what is included in and excluded from a
distribution, and what license the distribution is released under.  It is
also used to create the actual distribution source packages.  Autodist
allows distribution management in file, directory and file content level. 
Different distributions may include different portions of files, for
example, excluding certain features from certain distributions.  It is
always guaranteed that anything not defined for the distribution, is
removed automatically (files, file content, directories), thus ensuring
that nothing is accidentally included in the distribution.

   <p>The Autodist creates 'Makefile.am' files from 'Makefile.ad' files and
'configure.ac' file from one or more 'configure.ad' files.  Any other file
ending with '.ad' suffix will also be processed.  The processed file will
have the '.ad' suffix removed (see <a href="Preparing-source-tree.html#Preparing-source-tree">Preparing source tree</a>). 
Autodist also creates and packages the distribution using common GNU
distribution creation process, specifically `make dist'.  Autodist, however,
controls this process and during packaging phase the Autodist processes
all files in the distribution (other than '*.ad' files, which has already
been processed earlier by Autodist).  The resulted package is a processed
source distribution package, processed according to the rules specified
in the distribution file(s) (see <a href="Creating-distribution.html#Creating-distribution">Creating distribution</a>).

   <p>Any file in the source tree may use distdefs (distribution defines (see <a href="Distdefines.html#Distdefines">Distdefines</a>)) which are defined in the distributions.  When distribution
is packaged only the files, directories and file content that is either
outside of any distdef, or inside the defined distdefs will be included
in the distribution.  Any other file, directory or content in the file
will be removed.  It is guaranteed, if a file, a directory or a piece of
file content is not inside a defined distdef it will not be delivered to
the distribution.

   <p>Any file, 'Makefile.am', 'configure.ac', or source file processed with
Autodist is always compliant with the tools needed to process them.  All
files can also be processed with the corresponding tools even before
processing them with Autodist.  This makes it possible, for example, to
compile sources before they have been processed, and undefined lines
are removed.  The distdefs are respected in source files by the
preprocessor.

   <p>Autodist is not a binary packaging system.  It is specifically used to
create source distributions.  A binary packaging system, however can be
hooked to the distribution creation process, if needed.
